# Settlers of Catan - Reinforcement Learning Environment
Aim of the project is to build a simulation environment in Python that can be easily used with RL algorithms. I also wanted to make it human playable so that trained agents can be tested.

Still very much a work in progress - although the human playable interface seems to be fully functional now (but needs testing more extensively). There is a memory leak I'm aware of at the moment which means the game might get slower/eventually crash atm. Obviously will try and track this down ASAP.
